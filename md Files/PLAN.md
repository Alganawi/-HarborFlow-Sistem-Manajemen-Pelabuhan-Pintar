# HarborFlow WPF Project Development Plan - Phase 3

This plan outlines the next phase of development for the HarborFlow WPF application, focusing on improving code quality, adding new features, and enhancing the development experience.

## Phase 1: Code Quality and Robustness

1.  **Add Comprehensive Logging:**
    *   `[backend]` Inject `ILogger` into all services and ViewModels.
    *   `[backend]` Add logging for all important events, such as API calls, database operations, and errors.
2.  **Improve Error Handling:**
    *   `[backend]` Implement a global exception handler to catch unhandled exceptions.
    *   `[view]` Display user-friendly error messages for all exceptions.
3.  **Enhance Validation:**
    *   `[backend]` Add more validation rules to the `VesselValidator` and create validators for other models.
    *   `[view]` Display validation errors in the UI in a user-friendly way.

## Phase 2: Feature Enhancements

1.  **Offline Mode:**
    *   `[backend]` Implement a caching strategy to store data locally when the application is offline.
    *   `[backend]` Implement a synchronization mechanism to sync local data with the server when the application is back online.
    *   `[view]` Add a visual indicator to show the application's online/offline status.
2.  **Advanced Map Features:**
    *   `[view]` Add the ability to view a vessel's historical track on the map.
    *   `[view]` Add different map layers (e.g., satellite, nautical charts).
    *   `[view]` Implement clustering for vessel markers to improve performance with a large number of vessels.
3.  **User Profile Management:**
    *   `[backend]` Add a service to manage user profiles (e.g., change password, update profile information).
    *   `[view]` Create a user profile view where users can manage their profile.

## Phase 3: Development Experience

1.  **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   `[devops]` Create a GitHub Actions workflow to build and test the application on every push.
    *   `[devops]` Add a step to the workflow to create a release with the application installer.
2.  **Static Code Analysis:**
    *   `[devops]` Integrate SonarQube or another static analysis tool into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically check for code quality and security issues.
