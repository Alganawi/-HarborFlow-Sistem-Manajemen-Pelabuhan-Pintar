# Research Findings for HarborFlow WPF Project

## 1. Project Overview

- **Project Name**: HarborFlow
- **Objective**: To create a Smart Port Management System as a modern WPF desktop application using .NET 9. The system aims to digitize and streamline port operations, focusing on vessel tracking, service management, and stakeholder communication.
- **Core Problem Solved**: Addresses inefficiencies from manual processes, fragmented information, and lack of real-time vessel tracking in mid-sized ports.

## 2. Architecture & Technology Stack

- **Architecture**: The project successfully implements a 3-Tier Architecture with the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.
    - **Presentation**: `HarborFlow.Wpf` (WPF, .NET 9)
    - **Business Logic**: `HarborFlow.Application` (.NET 9 Class Library)
    - **Data Access**: `HarborFlow.Infrastructure` (.NET 9 Class Library)
    - **Core Models**: `HarborFlow.Core`
- **Technology Stack**:
    - **Framework**: .NET 9, WPF
    - **Database**: PostgreSQL 17 with Entity Framework Core 9 (Npgsql provider).
    - **Key Libraries**: `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`, `Microsoft.Web.WebView2` for the map component.
    - **Styling**: Fluent Design with support for Light/Dark themes.

## 3. Current Project Status

The project is in an advanced state, with all core features functionally complete using dummy data. The application is stable, and the foundational architecture is well-established.

- **Feature F-001: Map View & Vessel Tracking**:
    - **Status**: **Functionally Complete**.
    - **Details**: The map correctly displays vessels using a `WebView2` component with OpenStreetMap and Leaflet.js.
    - **Recent Progress**: The `VesselTrackingService.cs` has been **refactored** to support live data from the VesselFinder API. This includes logic to read an API key from `appsettings.json` and improved data mapping that converts the API's navigational status (`Navstat`) into the application's `VesselType` enum for more accurate vessel representation.
    - **Blocker**: The live data functionality is untested pending a real API key.

- **Feature F-002: Vessel Search**:
    - **Status**: **Complete**.
    - **Details**: Users can search for vessels by name or IMO number, with auto-complete functionality implemented.

- **Feature F-003: Port Service Management**:
    - **Status**: **Complete**.
    - **Details**: The full workflow for submitting, approving, and rejecting service requests, including document uploads, is functional.

- **Authentication and UI**:
    - **Status**: **Complete**.
    - **Details**: Role-based access control (RBAC), login/logout/register flows, and centralized window management are fully implemented. The UI uses a modern Fluent theme with light/dark mode support.

- **Testing**:
    - **Status**: **Partially Complete**.
    - **Details**: A test project (`HarborFlow.Tests`) exists with unit tests for key ViewModels and services. However, code coverage is not comprehensive.

## 4. Key Findings for Planning Phase

The research indicates that the project has successfully met its primary development goals and is now at a critical transition point from development with mock data to real-world integration and validation.

1.  **Immediate Priority: Live Data Integration Testing**:
    - The entire application's core value proposition hinges on real-time data. The code is now in place to consume the live API. The single most important next step is to **test this integration**.
    - **Action Item**: An API key for the VesselFinder service must be inserted into `appsettings.json`. The application must then be run to verify that live vessel data is fetched, correctly parsed, and displayed on the map.

2.  **Secondary Priority: Expand Test Coverage**:
    - With the introduction of live API logic, the `VesselTrackingService` has new, critical code paths that are untested.
    - **Action Item**: New unit tests should be written to cover the API data mapping logic, including the `ConvertNavStatToVesselType` helper method and the error handling/fallback mechanisms.

3.  **Tertiary Priority: Final Polish & Validation**:
    - Once live data is confirmed to be working, a final round of user acceptance testing (UAT) and UI polishing can be completed.
    - **Action Item**: Review all application features with live data to identify any minor bugs or UI inconsistencies.
