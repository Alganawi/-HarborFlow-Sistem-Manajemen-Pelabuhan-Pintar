# Research Findings for HarborFlow WPF Project

## 1. Project Overview

- **Project Name**: HarborFlow
- **Objective**: To create a Smart Port Management System as a modern WPF desktop application using .NET 9. The system aims to digitize and streamline port operations, focusing on vessel tracking, service management, and stakeholder communication.
- **Core Problem Solved**: Addresses inefficiencies from manual processes, fragmented information, and lack of real-time vessel tracking in mid-sized ports.

## 2. Architecture & Technology Stack

- **Architecture**: The project successfully implements a 3-Tier Architecture with the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.
    - **Presentation**: `HarborFlow.Wpf` (WPF, .NET 9)
    - **Business Logic**: `HarborFlow.Application` (.NET 9 Class Library)
    - **Data Access**: `HarborFlow.Infrastructure` (.NET 9 Class Library)
    - **Core Models**: `HarborFlow.Core`
- **Technology Stack**:
    - **Framework**: .NET 9, WPF
    - **Database**: PostgreSQL 17 with Entity Framework Core 9 (Npgsql provider).
    - **Key Libraries**: `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`, `Microsoft.Web.WebView2` for the map component.
    - **Styling**: Fluent Design with support for Light/Dark themes.

## 3. Current Project Status

The project is in an advanced state. The foundational architecture is well-established, and the core features are functionally complete based on the initial implementation.

- **Feature F-001: Map View & Vessel Tracking**:
    - **Status**: **Functionally Complete**.
    - **Details**: The map correctly displays vessels using a `WebView2` component. The `VesselTrackingService` is set up to connect to a live AIS data stream.

- **Feature F-002: Vessel Search**:
    - **Status**: **Complete**.
    - **Details**: Users can search for vessels by name or IMO number.

- **Feature F-003: Port Service Management**:
    - **Status**: **Complete**.
    - **Details**: The full workflow for submitting, approving, and rejecting service requests is functional.

- **Authentication and UI**:
    - **Status**: **Complete**.
    - **Details**: Role-based access control (RBAC), login/logout/register flows, and centralized window management are fully implemented. The UI uses a modern Fluent theme with light/dark mode support.

- **Testing**:
    - **Status**: **Partially Complete**.
    - **Details**: A test project (`HarborFlow.Tests`) exists with unit tests for ViewModels and services. The test coverage has been improved during the refactoring phase.

## 4. Key Findings for Planning Phase

The research indicates that the project has successfully met its primary development goals. The next logical step is to move from development to validation and deployment.

1.  **Immediate Priority: Live Data Integration Testing**:
    - The application's core value is dependent on real-time data. The next critical step is to test the live data integration.
    - **Action Item**: An API key for the AIS service needs to be configured in `appsettings.json`. The application must then be run to verify that live vessel data is fetched, parsed, and displayed correctly.

2.  **Secondary Priority: Comprehensive Testing**:
    - With the application being feature-complete, a comprehensive testing phase should be initiated.
    - **Action Item**: Perform thorough integration testing to ensure all components work together as expected. Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) to gather feedback on the user experience and identify any remaining bugs.

3.  **Tertiary Priority: Documentation and Deployment Preparation**:
    - The `README.md` file has been created. It should be reviewed and updated with any final details.
    - **Action Item**: Prepare the application for deployment, which may include creating an installer and documenting the deployment process.
